## INSTALL

- Following example is the basic way to install the tool:

cd shape-it
mkdir biuild
cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<where you want to install> ..
make
make install
```


- If you would like to use rdkit for shape-it please set BUILD_RDKIT_SUPPORT=ON. Also set BUID_PYTON_SUPPORT to ON, you can call shape-it as a library:


```
cd shape-it
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<where you want to install> -DBUILD_RDKIT_SUPPORT=ON -DBUILD_PYTHON_SUPPORT=ON ..
make
make install
```

## Tips
- If the make command failed, you should try to set RDKIT_INCLUDE_DIR, Boost_INCLUDE_DIR option.

```
cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/home/iwatobipen/src/shape-it-ob3 -DRDKIT_INCLUDE_DIR=/home/iwatobipen/miniconda3/envs/chemoinfo/include/rdkit -DBUILD_RDKIT_SUPPORT=ON -DBUILD_PYTHON_SUPPORT=ON -DBoost_INCLUDE_DIR=/home/iwatobipen/miniconda3/envs/chemoinfo/pkgs/libboost-1.73.0-hf484d3e_11/include ..
make
make install
```
